**What's the deal with this? Aren't there a million dad blogs?**

Yes. [Yes there are](https://www.google.com/search?q=dad+blog). This is yet another one. My name is Matt Andrews, I'm 32 years old, and just beginning the parenting journey with my partner Maddy and our son Theodore (Ted for short), born 24 April 2019.

**But why? What does this one do differently?**

Honestly? Probably nothing at all. Every new dad with a Macbook and a SnüzPod probably thinks "hey, I've got a fresh perspective on that little-discussed topic, child-rearing!" and heads over to Wordpress. I'm not naïve enough to think that anything I observe or record here is original or unique.

**Then why set this blog up?**

You're really glass-half-empty, aren't you? Well: because I want to document these early moments so that years from now I can look back and scoff at my past self's innocence and ignorance, and marvel at the things that I thought were difficult or challenging compared to whatever crisis we'll be going through in the next 5-10 years (the mind boggles).

I'm not really planning on offering parenting advice or tips and tricks because there's already far too much of that on the web (of dubious origin) to scare any potential new parent into avoiding Google for the rest of their life.

Instead I just want to document the things I'm learning and the mistakes I'm (inevitably) making, in the hope that it might amuse, enlighten or entertain others. Maybe when my son is a little older, I can show him these posts and hope that the sense of respect and empathy I'll have no doubt instilled in him will mean he'll sit back and say "wow, dad, you really did a lot for me". Or, you know, he'll just get angry at me for writing about his difficult toilet training. Either way, someone will learn something.

**Will you have any time to write a blog while bringing up your first child? Babies take a lot of attention, you know.**

Who knows. I'm writing this in the weird nether period where my partner is nine days overdue to give birth and both of us just want to move onto the next stage, however challenging it'll be. But I'd like to think that, if I can squeeze ten minutes of laptop time in between changing and feeding my son, then maybe I can share something here.

**Well, good luck.**

Thanks!
